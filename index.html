    <h2>My HTS apology</h2>
    <p>THIS IS UNFINISHED!</p>
    <p>Hello guys, BombCraft here. This is like my 4876572891763478490329764789th time apologizing, but I have to say this, I am sorry for any and all drama that I caused. I'm trying
    not to cause any more drama, but <a href=https://team-h-the-series.fandom.com/wiki/User:30IFanwiki>SOMEONE</a> is being annoying and I really don't like it. Anyway, I'm still
    really fucking sorry for the doxxing. For fuck's sake, it was <b>OVER A YEAR AGO</b> now. I have no clue how I haven't been forgiven for it, seeing as it was one silly little
    comment I posted without realizing the negative impact, and besides, I learned my lesson and won't do it again (the allegations of me doxxing garfieldfan are false btw, I WHOISed
    the IP that posted garfieldfan's location and it appears to be from Illinois, a state that I haven't set foot in since January 2016!) I know how serious doxxing can be, I mean a
    more severe doxx (e.g. one where the target's full name, address, and shit like that are revealed, rather than just the town that they live in) could cause, say, a burglar or
    murderer to break into the target's house and commit crimes. Okay, enough with random ass yapping and shit like that. I also would like to say that I no longer purport to be a
    member of Team H: The Series; I removed most (if not all) claims of me being a part of team HTS back in April (for example: if you played Im Glowing Insane when it was first
    uploaded, you'll know it originally said "Team H: The Series" right below my logo in the intro screen, however if you look at the intro screen now, you'll find "Tap for no jumpscare
    at the end" where "Team H: The Series" once was. Speaking of which, can someone post the ID to Im Glowing Insane in a bunch of mods' level request discord servers? I want it to be
    featured, but alas, I don't have a discord account. (A lot of mods have their level request servers on their profile, such as xLia) Also, fun fact: Blue has never beaten a weekly
    demon; for comparison, I've beaten 11. As for the being offensive to religion part, I am more tolerant of religions now. The only religious people I hate are the ones that are
    really annoying about it, like the people on <a href=https://reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake>r/religiousfruitcake</a>. I never bullied the Muslim classmate whom I shared many
    classes with back in 8th grade; I also never bullied any of my many Christian classmates; fuck it, I never really bullied anyone.</p>
    <p>Write shit here</p>
    <p>With that out of the way, I request the following:</p>
    <li>You are to accept that I am <b>not</b> permabanned. This is because infinite punishment for finite actions is stupid, and besides, what I did was only enough to warrant a ban
    until like 2025.</li>
    <li>My parts in H Travel and 50WTEH Volatility are not to be replaced. I am working on making 222-250 because no one else will, but it's on hold right now. As for H Travel, Blue
    will get part 18, beginning the Ignatius bossfight.</li>
    <li>The HTS wiki is to be altered to remove all the intense bias against me. This is H: The Series, not BombCraft Haters Club. Remember, all BombCraft haters should kill themselves!
    </li>
    <li>You are to stop calling me any of the names that are listed <a href=https:immediatemurderprofessionals.github.io/Things-you-are-NOT-allowed-to-call-me>here</a>. Failure to stop
    calling me those offensive names will result in me hiring I. M. P. to kill you.</li>
    <li>While according to D8fb, Blue stated that Hexagon should be banned from the H wiki (seeing as he’s banned), I’d only remove him as an admin, as I believe that he can contribute
    good things to the wiki (he does occasionally contribute false information, such as his fake description for bombium with the absurd claim that it is a “radioactive element”, but
    I’ll cover that later. As for the false info, I’ll try to get him to stop). I also believe that I would contribute good things to the wiki too, so…</li>
    <li>Anonymous contributions are to be reallowed. This is mostly because I want to contribute (I won’t interact with HTS members much as that violates what I said above, just random
    contributions and shit like that). All blocked IPs are to be unblocked, with the exception of the one that doxxed garfieldfan. (TS2021 is not an IP, so he shouldn’t be unblocked, as
    he only contributed to this wiki because I told him to)</li>
    <li>Bombium is to be given two stable isotopes, B-53 and B-55. The element's description is to be reverted to <a href=https://team-h-the-series.fandom.com/wiki/Bombium?oldid=961>
    this edit</a>. That is because since the element is <b>MINE</b>, <b>I</b> get to decide everything about it. Hexagon has <b>NO SAY</b> in <b>ANYTHING</b> about Bombium.</li>
    <li>This is unfinished.</li>
