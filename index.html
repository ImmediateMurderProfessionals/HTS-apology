    <h2>My HTS apology</h2>
    <p>THIS IS UNFINISHED!</p>
    <p>Hello guys, BombCraft here. This is like my 4876572891763478490329764789th time apologizing, but I have to say this, I am sorry for any and all drama that I caused. I'm trying
    not to cause any more drama, but <a href=https://team-h-the-series.fandom.com/wiki/User:30IFanwiki>SOMEONE</a> is being annoying and I really don't like it. Anyway, I'm still
    really fucking sorry for the doxxing. For fuck's sake, it was <b>OVER A YEAR AGO</b> now. I have no clue how I haven't been forgiven for it, seeing as it was one silly little
    comment I posted without realizing the negative impact, and besides, I learned my lesson and won't do it again (the allegations of me doxxing garfieldfan are false btw, I WHOISed
    the IP that posted garfieldfan's location and it appears to be from Illinois, a state that I haven't set foot in since January 2016!) I know how serious doxxing can be, I mean a
    more severe doxx (e.g. one where the target's full name, address, and shit like that are revealed, rather than just the town that they live in) could cause, say, a burglar or
    murderer to break into the target's house and commit crimes. Okay, enough with random ass yapping and shit like that. I also would like to say that I no longer purport to be a
    member of Team H: The Series; I removed most (if not all) claims of me being a part of team HTS back in April (for example: if you played Im Glowing Insane when it was first
    uploaded, you'll know it originally said "Team H: The Series" right below my logo in the intro screen, however if you look at the intro screen now, you'll find "Tap for no jumpscare
    at the end" where "Team H: The Series" once was. Speaking of which, can someone post the ID to Im Glowing Insane in a bunch of mods' level request discord servers? I want it to be
    featured, but alas, I don't have a discord account. (A lot of mods have their level request servers on their profile, such as xLia) Also, fun fact: Blue has never beaten a weekly
    demon; for comparison, I've beaten 11. As for the being offensive to religion part, I am more tolerant of religions now. The only religious people I hate are the ones that are
    really annoying about it, like the people on <a href=https://reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake>r/religiousfruitcake</a>. I never bullied the Muslim classmate whom I shared many
    classes with back in 8th grade; I also never bullied any of my many Christian classmates; fuck it, I never really bullied anyone.</p>
