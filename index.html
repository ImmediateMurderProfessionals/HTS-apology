    <h2>My HTS apology</h2>
    <p><b>THIS IS UNFINISHED!</b></p>
    <p>Hello guys, BombCraft here. This is like my 4876572891763478490329764789th time apologizing, but I have to say this, I am sorry for any and all drama that I caused. I'm trying
    not to cause any more drama, but <a href=https://team-h-the-series.fandom.com/wiki/User:30IFanwiki>SOMEONE</a> is being annoying and I really don't like it. Anyway, I'm still
    really fucking sorry for the doxxing. For fuck's sake, it was <b>OVER A YEAR AGO</b> now. I have no clue how I haven't been forgiven for it, seeing as it was one silly little
    comment I posted without realizing the negative impact, and besides, I learned my lesson and won't do it again (the allegations of me doxxing garfieldfan are false btw, I WHOISed
    the IP that posted garfieldfan's location and it appears to be from Illinois, a state that I haven't set foot in since January 2016!) I know how serious doxxing can be, I mean a
    more severe doxx (e.g. one where the target's full name, address, and shit like that are revealed, rather than just the town that they live in) could cause, say, a burglar or
    murderer to break into the target's house and commit crimes. Okay, enough with random ass yapping and shit like that. I also would like to say that I no longer purport to be a
    member of Team H: The Series; I removed most (if not all) claims of me being a part of team HTS back in April (for example: if you played Im Glowing Insane when it was first
    uploaded, you'll know it originally said "Team H: The Series" right below my logo in the intro screen, however if you look at the intro screen now, you'll find "Tap for no 
    jumpscare at the end" where "Team H: The Series" once was. As a result of me no longer purporting to be a member of HTS, you can stop calling me delusional now. I really hate it.
    Speaking of Im Glowing Insane, can someone please post the ID to Im Glowing Insane in a bunch of GD moderators' level request discord servers? I spent 4 months on it and really
    want it to be featured, but alas, I don't have a discord account. (A lot of mods have their level request servers on their GD profile, such as xLia) Also, fun fact: Blue has never
    beaten a weekly demon; for comparison, I've beaten 11. As for the being offensive to religion part, I am more tolerant of religions now. The only religious people I hate are the
    ones that are really annoying about it, like the people on <a href=https://reddit.com/r/religiousfruitcake>r/religiousfruitcake</a>. I never bullied the Muslim classmate whom I
    shared many classes with back in 8th grade; I also never bullied any of my many Christian classmates; fuck it, I never really bullied anyone.</p>
    <p>I will try to stop annoying you about HTS (or really, just talking about HTS in general). I will likely rejoin sometime in the future (no earlier than my 15th birthday but
    probably no later than my 18th birthday). I am also making H projects that will be shared and added to H when I rejoin, such as 50WTEH 222-250 and a fixed version of the H
    Isotopic Table. I will still talk to H makers, but not about H. (This statement is elaborated below)</p>
    <p>(TLDR I am extremely sorry for all the bad shit I did please forgive me and I will stop annoying you about H but I will keep talking to you about things unrelated to H)</p>
    <p>With that out of the way, I request the following:</p>
    <li>You are to accept that I am <b>not</b> permabanned. This is because infinite punishment for finite actions is stupid, and besides, what I did was only enough to warrant a ban
    until like 2025.</li>
    <li>You are to accept that Hexagon is also <b>not</b> permabanned. This is also because infinite punishment for finite actions is stupid. In my opinion, Hexagon and I should both
    be banned until we get a bit more mature (likely age 15-16, seeing as Blue got studio host a month before he turned 16.)</li>
    <li>My parts in H Travel and 50WTEH Volatility are not to be replaced. I am working on making 222-250 because no one else will, but it's on hold right now. As for H Travel, Blue
    will get part 18, beginning the Ignatius bossfight. As for 50WTEHV, Hexagon's 214 and 215, which are in progress, will be accepted under 2 conditions: 1. They will have to be moved
    to 50WTEH part 6 (likely 264 and 265). 2. If those deaths are offensive to me, which they likely will be, they will be rejected.</li>
    <li>The HTS wiki is to be altered to remove all the intense bias against me. This is H: The Series, not BombCraft Haters Club. Remember, all BombCraft haters should kill
    themselves! (/j, if it wasn't obvious already) Failure to remove all the intense bias against me may result in me sending you a cease and desist letter and/or suing you for 
    defamation</li>
    <li>You are to stop calling me any of the names that are listed <a href=https:immediatemurderprofessionals.github.io/Things-you-are-NOT-allowed-to-call-me>here</a>. Failure to stop
    calling me those offensive names will result in me hiring I. M. P. to kill you.</li>
    <li>While according to D8fb, Blue stated that Hexagon should be banned from the H wiki (seeing as he’s banned), I’d only remove him as an admin, as I believe that he can contribute
    good things to the wiki (he does occasionally contribute false information, such as his fake description for bombium with the absurd claim that it is a “radioactive element”, but
    I’ll cover that later. As for the false info, I’ll try to get him to stop). I also believe that I would contribute good things to the wiki too, so…</li>
    <li>Anonymous contributions are to be reallowed. This is mostly because I want to contribute (I won’t interact with HTS members much as that violates what I said above, just random
    contributions and shit like that). All blocked IPs are to be unblocked, with the exception of the one that doxxed garfieldfan. (TS2021 is not an IP, so he shouldn’t be unblocked,
    as he only contributed to this wiki because I told him to)</li>
    <li>Back to the hexagon thing, <img src=/HTS-apology/People who do this should not be admins.png> People who do this should not be admins (screenshot from the HTS wiki deletion log,
    btw)</li>
    <li>Bombium is to be given two stable isotopes, B-53 and B-55. The element's description is to be reverted to <a href=https://team-h-the-series.fandom.com/wiki/Bombium?oldid=961>
    this edit</a>. That is because since the element is <b>MINE</b>, <b>I</b> get to decide everything about it. Hexagon has <b>NO SAY</b> in <b>ANYTHING</b> about Bombium.</li>
    <li>All dates in the H wiki are to use MM/DD/YYYY instead of the far inferior DD/MM/YYYY. This is because HTS is owned by an American, so we use  the American format. Scratch ALSO
    uses MM/DD/YYYY, so there's that.</li>
    <li>The H periodic table is to be changed to be structured like its real equivalent. NLTS has no say in its structuring because the H periodic table, like its real equivalent, is
    structured based on electron configuration, and electron configuration is not different in H elements compared to real ones. A fixed version of the heriodic table is on my github
    profile, but it's a bit outdated so I still need to fix it some more.</li>
    <li><img src=/HTS-apology/Lmao the image is cropped because of a bug in chess.com.png> This is to be removed from Blue's chess.com bio, as I no longer claim to be a member of HTS.
    </li>
    <li>The text "He won't stop yapping about his GD levels like Im Glowing Insane, saying they are better than Minuit when nothing can out beat Minuit." is to be removed from the HTS
    wiki article on me. This is because Im Glowing Insane is, in fact, better than Minuit. Minuit is good for a new creator (just barely rateworthy, but that's mostly because of the
    time spent verifying it and the fact that the song is an absolute banger), however it pales in comparison to Im Glowing Insane. Hexagon likely hasn't played Im Glowing Insane based
    on the fact that he added that false claim.</li>
    <li>I am to have more of a say in what goes on in the Heriodic Table because I know the most about the real life periodic table and my suggestions are better than yours.</li>
    <li>Hexagon should have less of a say. He shouldn't be able to decide literally everything about the heriodic table because he's banned and also most of his suggestions suck.</li>
    <li>Hexagon's HTS isotopic table is to be made fake too. I am currently working on a better version of it, but since it's on Scratch, I will post progress occasionally to Github.
    The \unfinished version of my fixed isotopic table can be found <a href=https://github.com/ImmediateMurderProfessionals/The-H-isotopic-table-but-it-doesn-t-suck-ass/tree/main>
    here</a>.</li>
    <li>"Hresemias", "Tseauleras", "Hastearun", and "Dodecahedron's Fostulate" are to be all made non-canon. H elements should be made of H protons, H neutrons, and H electrons, which
    are similar (but not the same) to their real life counterparts.</li>
    <li>Hexagon and his metajokes should less significant in H lore. My metajokes are better. #ANGELDUSTSMOOTHIEFORLIFE</li>
    <li>NLTS is to recognize the fact that Helluva Boss is better than BFDI. (/hj)</li>
    <li>Blue is to recognize the fact that Splatoon 3 is better than KTANE. (/hj)</li>
    <li>All claims that I am "not trustworthy" are to be removed from the H wiki. This is because I am trustworthy.</li>
    <li>The spelling in the H wiki article for whamageddon is to be fixed; the article's title has two "M"s but the correct spelling only has one "M".</li>
    <li>Karum is to be moved to 107, with its name slightly changed to "Karium" and its atomic symbol changed to "Ka". Nuine (Nu, based on N: The Series) will be the new 52. Karium
    should not be produced with Bombium and Hexium because elements do not react like that. Bombium and Hexium should actually produce a chemical that immediately explodes when they
    react.</li>
    <li>Unsium is to be replaced with the radioactive Cecilium (Cc, named after CecilGamer)
    <li>Deludirium is to be removed and replaced with Waveium (Wv, based on H3447).</li>
    <li>Noncanium is to be moved to 112 and altered; the original Noncanium was a targeted attack towards me that only referred to my suggestions (I never said they were canon I said
    they were suggestions that should be canon), the new Noncanium refers to all non-canon things (e.g. Deludirium). The empty space at 67 is to be filled by the radioactive
    Miltricubium (Mt, named after 1027).</li>
    <li>Hexagon's suggested element Gaelion is to be rejected because it has nothing to do with H.</li>
    <li>Hexagon's other suggested element Kapaturium shouldn't be rejected, but most of the properties he has stated shouldn't be canon. Kapatur also has nothing to do with H, but I
    will still give Kapatur an element by having Kapatur synthesize that element (I have suggested elements all the way up to 138, the latest discovered as of June 2024, and the ones
    past ~121 are named after famous scientists or where they were synthesized, for the most part. (e.g. 127 is Bosium named after Satyendra Nath Bose, and 136 is Ritium because it was
    first synthesized in Rito Village in 2010). The way this would work would be that Kapatur synthesizes element 139 sometime in like July and names the element after itself.</li>
    <li>Hexagon's other other suggested element Immaturium is to be rejected for being based on the claim that Hexagon is more mature than me, which is the falsest claim that has ever
    been said.</li>
    <li>Whamium and Tescratium should be radioactive, and Ledium should be stable. If TS2021 wishes, I may give Tescratium one or two stable isotopes.</li>
    <li>"It was discovered by Hexagon, Queen of Setru, to be stable." Quit your bullshit, the way Whamium is produced would produce all of its stable isotopes if it had stable isotopes
    but it has no stable isotopes so the method of production (a similar method to how IRL elements ~26-30 are produced in space) only makes radioactive isotopes.</li>
    <li>The atomic symbol for Scratchcatnium should be changed to Sp (stands for "Sprite1") because Studium (element 74, suggested by 1234567890_owot) is already St.</li>
    <li>You are to STOP censoring my username when talking about me in HTS. Call me BombCraft or ObamaCraft. Don't call me zombcraft, dElUsIoNaL, plumpcraft, he who must not be named,
    [REDACTED], that ;) guy, or any other offensive bullshit. Failure to stop censoring my username will result in capital punishment.</li>
    <li>You all should unblock me on chess.com and GD. While I said I'll stop annoying you about H, we can still talk about other things and play nice games of chess. I can also give
    Blue creator tips so he gets better at GD. Fuck it, here's one right now: Use particle effects. They can make great backgrounds and foregrounds, along with their intended use
    which is, well, particles (such as snowflakes falling or the embers coming from the lava in Dash). It's not hard to learn how to use particle effects, and I would suggest looking
    at particle effects that others made (such as the ones in Im Glowing Insane) to see how particles work. I'd also suggest playing around with particles as another method of
    learning how to use particles.</li>
    <li>The H wiki article on me should include more info about me than just my ban. My ban is not my entire personality, and I have done many good things in H too, such as H3150 and
    H3447.</li>
    <li>The Whamageddon 2023 standings should be changed. There are multiple errors (a few H makers' stats are wrong, specifically exam_ple was actually in Whamhalla L3, not L2, and
    anusername0101 was actually in L8, not L7. Also, Dubstepv1 is banned from Whamageddon for making an H that plays Last Christmas (even still, he was actually in Whamhalla L5, not
    L4), and I was in Whamhalla L19, but I am not in the standings for some dumb reason. The fixed whamageddon standings can be found at
    https://immediatemurderprofessionals.github.io/HTS-The-Website/whamageddon/.</li>
    <li>I don't know if I already said this, but you should forgive me for all the bad shit I did in H. I am extremely sorry and will NOT do it again. I pinky promise.</li>
    <li>Give me a good flavor text and not "...don't trust that guy" or any of that bullshit.</li>
    <li>The false info about me is to be removed from my HTS wiki article. My first H was actually H2871, not 2884, and I joined Scratch January 1, 2022, not January 2.</li>
    <li>Hexagon's version of HTS is to be declared fake by virtue of it not existing. My version is to be regarded as real, but note that my website does need some improvements, so
    I may let a few of you guys work on it along with me.</li>
    <li>This is unfinished. (But close to being finished)</li>
