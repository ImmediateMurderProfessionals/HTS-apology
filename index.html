    <h2>My HTS apology</h2>
    <p>THIS IS UNFINISHED!</p>
    <p>Hello guys, BombCraft here. This is like my 4876572891763478490329764789th time apologizing, but I have to say this, I am sorry for any and all drama that I caused. I'm trying
    not to cause any more drama, but <a href=https://team-h-the-series.fandom.com/wiki/User:30IFanwiki>SOMEONE</a> is being annoying and I really don't like it. Anyway, I'm still
    really fucking sorry for the doxxing. For fuck's sake, it was <b>OVER A YEAR AGO</b> now. I have no clue how I haven't been forgiven for it, seeing as it was one silly little
    comment I posted without realizing the negative impact, and besides, I learned my lesson and won't do it again (the allegations of me doxxing garfieldfan are false btw, I WHOISed
    the IP that posted garfieldfan's location and it appears to be from Illinois, a state that I haven't set foot in since January 2016!) I know how serious doxxing can be, I mean a
    more severe doxx (e.g. one where the target's full name, address, and shit like that are revealed, rather than just the town that they live in) could cause, say, a burglar or
    murderer to break into the target's house and commit crimes. Okay, enough with random ass yapping and shit like that.</p>
